Log to keep track of all choices so I dont forget
Different pages for different choices. Some choices dependent on others, etc.
THE LOWER THE NUMBER = TRUE PATH IN ANY GIVEN ORDER, SO C3 IS TRUE PATH, C4 IS OFF ROUTE.
Another example would be if given choices c5, c6, c7, c5 would be the true route, no deviation.

c1 - Simple continue, no choice (leads to page 2)
c2 - Continue, no choice (leads to page 3)
c3 - Remain calm and explain - charm + 1 (page 4)
c4 - Panic and deny the accusation - alt dialogue (page 5)
MAX POSSIBLE CHARM BY c4 = 1
c5 = Continue, no choice (page 6)
c6 = Continue, no choice (page 7)
